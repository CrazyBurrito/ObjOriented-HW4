Part 1:
1.I identified the hard-coded numbers that needed to be replaced with symbolic constants.
2. I made global variables initialHunger, initialSize, starvingLevel, smallSize, hungryLevel, and bigSize.
3. Removed hard-coded numbers 0.9 (ln36), 1.0 (ln37), 0.2 (ln83), 7.0 (ln85), 0.7 (ln101), 5.0 (ln104) and replaced with the appropriate constants.

Part 2:
1. I created avstract class FishStrategy.
2. I moved the conditional logic in the move() method to the strategy.
3. In Fish() I created a field for the strategy.
4. I updated the move() method to delegate to the strategy.
5. I created subcalsses of the strategy for each condition the fish could have and put each action in the respective subclass.
6. I created an updateMoveStrategy() method to Fish() that sets the value of the strategy needed.
7. I added a call to updateMoveStrategy in both the constructor and age() methods.
